# OOP Assignments (DIT043)
This repository contains my university OOP assignments, written in Java, when studying the *Software Engineering and Management* program at Gothenburg University / Chalmers University of Technology.
Prior to this I had no experience in programming or Software Engineering.

- [`Assignment-01`](/src/main/java/assignment01) was done after 1-2 weeks of programming.

- [`Assignment-02`](/src/main/java/assignment02) was done after 3-4 weeks of programming.

- [`Assignment-03`](/src/main/java/assignment03) was done after 5-6 weeks of programming.

No generative AI was used to solve these assignments in any way whatsoever.


## Running the code
- Open the project in IntelliJ (or any IDE).
- Mark `src/main/java` as *Sources Root* and `src/test/java` as *Test Sources Root*.
- Use JDK 18+.
- The project includes JUnit 5 (console standalone jar in `lib/`).
